# ntCPPpred: A Non-Toxic Cell-Penetrating Peptide Prediction Tool

Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have carved out a significant niche in the realm of drug delivery and therapeutics. Their role as efficient drug delivery vehicles is promising, but it's vital to ensure their non-toxicity for therapeutic applications. Safe and effective use is of utmost priority.

With this backdrop, ntCPPpred emerges as a pioneering computational tool, harnessing the power of Weka's machine learning capabilities. This tool seamlessly integrates state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, providing both researchers and developers a reliable and accurate prediction mechanism. The primary objective? To assist in certifying the non-toxicity of CPPs, ensuring they are fit and ready for therapeutic integrations.
